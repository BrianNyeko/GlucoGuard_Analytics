    Diabetes is a chronic condition, where either not enough insulin is being produced or the body is not able to use insulin(Type 1) to stabilise the glucose levels(Type 2). About 0.2% of all 30-day hospital readmissions consists on patients with diabetes mellitus(DM)[1]. Factors that increase the risk of being readmitted include comorbidities, repeated readmissions, demographics and length of stay[3].  By reducing hospital readmissions there is a potential of improving healthcare whilst reducing the healthcare costs[2]. 
    
    The web dashboard will provide the end user(healthcare professionals(Physicians, Nurses, Dieticians), Patients, healthcare providers and hospital management) with information concerning the 30-day readmission rates for diabetes patients.
